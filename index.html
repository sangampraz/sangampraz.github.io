    <h1>Hello, Welcome to my GitHub IO Page</h1>
    <p>I am a junior Computer Science student at Seattle Pacific University, and I truly enjoy coding especially at night. The calm atmosphere helps me think more clearly and stay focused. My coding process begins with reading and understanding the project requirements. I visualize the system as a whole, break it down into key components, and plan the order in which tasks need to be done. Once I have a rough structure in mind, I divide the project into smaller, manageable parts, often writing pseudocode before I begin the actual implementation. Even when my logic seems sound, I often discover bugs or improvements during the coding process. Testing and debugging are essential steps that help refine my code and make it more reliable. I find joy in every stage of development: from the initial idea to the final, working solution.
